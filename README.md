# A basic web project

This is a little help to get you started with a simple website. Clone (or download) the project and start to make something nice.

This project basically contains nothing apart form its structure. The sample HTML and CSS is derived form [Typebase.css](http://devinhunt.github.io/typebase.css) which you can use as a starting point. (Consider to use normalize.css, or more advanced frameworks [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Pure](https://purecss.io/) or [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) instead.)

## Structure

```
assets/
  css/
    style.css
  images/
    favicon.png
    ...
  js/
    script.js
index.html
README.md
.nojekyll
.gitignore
```

This project is prepared for Hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/).

`.nojekyll` is included to host static pages on GitHub pages [without an active Jekyll](https://blog.github.com/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/) (a content management system) installation.

`.gitignore` will prevent common unnecessary OS-generated files (Windows and Mac) like. `Thumbs.db` and `.DS_Store` to end up in your git repository.

## HTML / CSS Reference

look up your HTML and CSS at Mozilla. They know the web pretty well.
