# A basic web project

This is a little help to get you started with a simple website. Clone (or download) the project and start to make something nice.

This project basicly conaints nothing apart form its structure. The sample HTML and CSS is derived form [Typebase.css](http://devinhunt.github.io/typebase.css) which you can use as a starting poing. (Consider to use normalize.css, or more advanced frameworks [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Pure](https://purecss.io/) or [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) instead.)
